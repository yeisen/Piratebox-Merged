<div style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by pirate radio and the free
culture
movment, PirateBox is a self-contained mobile collaboration and file
sharing device. PirateBox utilizes Free, Libre and Open Source software
(FLOSS) to create mobile wireless file sharing networks where users can
anonymously share images, video, audio, documents, and other digital
content.<br>
<br>
PirateBox is designed to be safe and
secure. No logins are required and
no user data is logged. The system is purposely not connected to the
Internet in order to prevent tracking and preserve user privacy.<br>
<br>
PirateBox was created by David Darts and is registered under a Free Art
License (2011). To learn more about the project or to find out how to
build your own PirateBox system, please visit
